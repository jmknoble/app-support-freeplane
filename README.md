## What's Here

- My preferred [templates](freeplane/templates) for use with Freeplane –
  copy these to your personal Freeplane **templates** directory (on a Mac,
  `~/.freeplane/1.9.x/templates`).
- My preferred [custom keyboard shortcuts](freeplane/accelerators) for Mac and
  Ubuntu – copy to your Freeplane **accelerators** directory (on a Mac,
  `~/.freeplane/1.9.x/accelerators`).
- My preferred [preferences](freeplane/preferences) for Mac and Ubuntu – to
  use, load them from the Freeplane **Preferences** dialog.

## What's Freeplane?

Freeplane is an open source Java-based desktop application for creating [mind
map]s.  It works on Mac, Linux, and Windows.  See [freeplane.org][] for
further info.


### A few things Freeplane is reasonably good at

- Outlining and drafting a complex [Markdown][] document:
    - Create your mind map using my
      [markdown-mind-map-template.mm](freeplane/templates/markdown-mind-map-template.mm)
      template.
    - Nodes become headings.
    - Node details become text.
    - Export your mindap as Markdown.
    - See the [Markdown Guide][] for an easy start to Markdown,
- Organizing topics such as epics and features for project planning:
    - The project is the central node.
    - Epics are the next-level nodes.
    - Features are next.
    - Stories can be next.
    - Export your mind map as XLS, and you can open it as a spreadsheet.
    - With some tweaking, you may be able to turn the spreadsheet into
      something loadable into Azure DevOps work items.
